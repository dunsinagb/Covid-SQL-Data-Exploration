## SQL Data Exploration

I made the decision to use PostgreSQL to do an exploratory data analysis on a Covid-19 dataset. 
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths is the link to the dataset. 
I began to get a sense of the data after connecting to the database and conducting some preliminary queries. 
I began to see some patterns when I examined the distribution of COVID cases, deaths, and immunizations on a national, continental, and worldwide level. 
I continued my research to learn the population vaccination rate and overall vaccination rate for each nation. 
Overall, it was a terrific learning experience for postgreSQL and for working with enormous datasets.
